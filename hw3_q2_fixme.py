# This program estimates the average number of leaves on a tree in an "average"
# forest.  We will assume the following:
#
# 1) The forest has roughly 1000 trees with a Gaussian standard deviation of 126
# 2) The trees vary in age from 1 year to 100 years with a linearly increasing age profile
# 3) Each tree has number of branches that follows a Poisson distribution with mean age*2+3
# 4) Each branch has a number of leaves that is drawn randomly from the function 10+20*sqrt(age)
#
# The goal is to plot the number of leaves for 1000 forests.
# In doing so, we should also plot the distributions in 1-4 as a sanity check.
# Finally, we need to report the average number of trees in in our "average" forest.
#
# Don't forget to calculate some averages so that everything can be checked step by step

# This code will not work as is.  You must fix all coding errors before proceeding.
# There are also logic errors that will significantly alter the results of the simulation.
# Fix the errors to reproduce the results listed in the homework text.
